My journey to become a JEDI(master of Life and Force) by reading atleast 3 books per month. The categories I will be reading about will be,

1) :computer: - Computer Science and Programming (Its my passion and what I do for money),
2) :mortar_board: - Life and Philosophy (I want to understand the real meaning of life and success),
3) :boy: - Self Help (Help my self in general),
4) :triangular_ruler: - Math and Physics ( although I love them they still are my weak points),
5) :moneybag: - Economics and Money (obviously, I want hell lot of money).


I'll also try to make notes and write a breif summary of the books I read so that I can remember and revise them when I need :fire::fire:.

Let the Journey Begin :rocket::sailboat::airplane: .....
